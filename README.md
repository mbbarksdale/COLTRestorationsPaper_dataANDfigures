# Data & Figures for COLT Restorations Paper
These Matlab files contain outputs (and codes used to analyze those outputs) from the model COLT_Restorations (link: https://github.com/mbbarksdale/CoLT_Restorations). These files are also stored in the Zenodo repository found at the following link: https://zenodo.org/badge/883248578.svg. All figures and data analyzed during the study described in Barksdale et al. (currently in submission at Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences) are included in these data files.

To operate the COLTRestorations_FiguresProduction, you must have downloaded from the Matlab File Exchange, arrow.m, subaxis.m, and drawbrace.m, and stored them in the same folder as the model results. Your Matlab file path must be routed to the folder with all model results.

The MARindex and VASEA codes are unnecessary for recreating figures but reveal how certain data were post-processed and graphed.
