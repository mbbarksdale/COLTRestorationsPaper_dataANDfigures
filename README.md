# Data & Figures for COLT Restorations Paper
These Matlab files accompany the model COLT_Restorations (link: https://github.com/mbbarksdale/CoLT_Restorations) and are part of the submission of the paper Barksdale et al. to Geophysical Research Letters.

To operate the COLTRestorations_FiguresProduction, you must have downloaded from the Matlab File Exchange, arrow.m, subaxis.m, and drawbrace.m, and stored them in the same folder as the model results. Your Matlab file path must be routed to the folder with all model results.

The MARindex and VASEA codes are unnecessary for recreating figures but reveal how certain data were post-processed and graphed.
